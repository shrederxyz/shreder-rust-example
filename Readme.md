# Shreder Rust Example

Shreder is the fastest way to get block updates and receive transaction data on Solana.
Basically, Shreder is a shred streaming service. We stream raw transaction data (shreds) directly to your app â€” no polling, no delays.
Shreder allows you to receive streaming data with Solana network transactions in real-time (0 block).

## Description

This repository demonstrates a basic project to test Shreder and consume transactions. It contains 2 examples with entries and transactions consuming.
